<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://case.edu/" target="_blank">Case Western Reserve University</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://engineering.case.edu/groups/xusheng-xiao/" target="_blank">Dr. Xusheng Xiao</a>. My research interests are in the fields of software security, deep learning/AI in software security, and data mining. </p>
<h2>Research Projects</h2>
<p>Automatic Generation for Android Applications. This project focus on extracting various features from Android apps, including textual information from apps' layout files, source code representations (call graphs), and corpus from apps' privacy policies. By inputing these features to modern NLP models with rich attention mechanisms, the model is able to generate accurate, app-specific sensitive behavior descriptions for the end users to easily understand the functionalities of the apps, and to get insights on the intentions of the sensitive behaviors/the usage of dangerous permissions.</p>
<p>Android Malware Detection. Our goal is to develop a tool to accurately detect and identify various Android malware. Further, we are going to expand our work to identify undesired behaviors of the apps, such as ad disruption, failling to start. Currently, we focus on the representations of the binary of the app because the binaries are more robust against modern code-obfuscation techniques. Our preliminary results shows that state-of-the-art techniques are not able to work on identifying undesired behaviors properly, because SOTA techniques mainly extract features such as texts and intents from the apps, which are also widely used in benign apps. Therefore, it is difficult for the deep learning models to identify malicious behaviors using such features.</p>
